# tic-tac-toe
Creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JS. My main goal here is to have as little global scope clutter as possible. I will be leaning heavy into factory functions and or modules. If I need ONE of something, I will use a module. If I need multiple of something, I will use factories.
